âœ‹ - Hey there!

While learning the basics of JAVA and OOP, I was challenged to develop a game in about 48h.
I worked with a small group and we developed a street-fighter type game. It was a great way to learn about multithreading and I/O mechanics!

ðŸ“¬ - Feel free to hit me up with any criticism or question!
