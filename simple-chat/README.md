While working on an JAVA assigment about Sockets and Multithreading, I was challenged to develop a simple webchat applications, and so I did!

Did not have the time to get it exactly where I wanted it, but it has multiple functionalitys:
- Simple chat
- Server Broadcast
- Chat clear
- Whisper specific user
- List all the users online

TO-DO:
- Room creation
- Room changing
