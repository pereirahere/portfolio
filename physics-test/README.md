✋ - Hey there!

While learning the basics of JAVA and OOP, I got a little side tracked when a simple graphics library was presented to me, and decided to play around with physics!
So I created a simple ball and a simple floor, and went nuts on the keyboard, trying stuff out!

🏀

Keys: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

My little ball bounces, accelerates, decelerates and it even kicks of the wall! This was a fun experiment.
