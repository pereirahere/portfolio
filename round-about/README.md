âœ‹ - Hey there!

Hackathon is an <Academia de CÃ³digo/> contest that asks you and your group to develop an application in 24h straight. 
The application has a song as a theme, and our song was "Roundabout" by Yes!

After some brain-storming we decided to develop a real-world, outdoor adventure game, much like Geocaching, but instead of caches, you find roundabouts!

It was a crazy fun experience (specially because my group won the contest! ðŸ’ª) and it was a great chance to solidify technologies and concepts like:
- Spring
- Thymeleaf
- Servlet
- Maven
- Tomcat
- HTML
- Javascript
- Scrum Methodology
- MVC Architecture

It's a shame we didn't have the time to apply persistence, maybe in the future!

ðŸ“¬ - Feel free to hit me up with any criticism or question!
